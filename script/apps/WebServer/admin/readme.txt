# Admin Site Framework

`WebServer/admin` is a open source NPL-based web site framework. I have implemented it according to the famous `WordPress.org` blog site. The default theme template is based on "sensitive" which is a free theme of wordpress. "sensitive" theme has no dependency on media and can adjust display and layout according to screen width, which is suitable for showing on mobile phone device. 

## How to use
   * copy everything in this folder to your own web site root, say /www/MySite/
   * modify wp-content/database/*.xml for site description and menus. 
   * add your own web pages to wp-content/pages/, which are accessed by their filename in the url.
   * If you want more customization to the look, modify the wp-content/themes/sensitive or create your own theme folder. Remember to set your theme in `wp-content/database/table_sitemeta.xml`, which contains all options for the site. 

## Architecture
	The architecture is based on Wordpress.org (4.0.1). Although everything is rewritten in NPL, I have kept all functions, filters, and file names identical to wordpress. 
	See `wp-includes/` for the framework source code.

Code locations:
	* framework loader is in `wp-settings.page`
	* site options: `wp-content/database/table_sitemeta.xml`: such as theme, default menu, etc.
	* menus: `wp-content/database/table_nav_menu.xml`

## Ajax framework
	Any request url begins with `ajax/xxx` use the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.page`. it will automatically load the page xxx.  and invoke `do_action('wp_ajax_xxx')`. 
	If the request url begins with `ajax/xxx?action=yyy`, then page xxx is loaded, and `do_action('wp_ajax_xxx')` is invoked. 
	A page that handles ajax request needs to call `add_action('wp_ajax_xxx'£¬ function_name)` to register a handler for ajax actions. 
	see `wp-content/pages/aboutus.page` for an example.
